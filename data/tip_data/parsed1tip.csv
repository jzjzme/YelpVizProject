Water.. $5 for small bottle. See giraffe.. $5 per person. Ride a train...$8 per person. It is horrible!! The animal areas are so far in distance you simply cannot see Anything u less you pay per person to get close. A better local choice is wildlife zoo or out of Africa.

Naked helped me with my brakes in a big way,  now I can finally get back out in the trails.  Each member of the staff was super knowledgeable and customer oriented. Mark offered suggestions to improve my ride while not being pushy at all. The whole experience was enjoyable and I look forward to coming back to the  Slippery  Pig!!!

However I think they should massage the head too so it can stimulate the scalp for more hair growth. I will have to ask them next time I can't believe that I just thought of that.

They called me a week later to give me and estimate of 110-130 dollars.  Which is ridiculous for this service should be about 50 bucks.  Then charged me $18 for the diagnosis which I already new. then owner suggested I just not pay the $18 fee because the trimmer wasn't worth it since it wasn't working.
